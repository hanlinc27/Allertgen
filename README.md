# ðŸ¥‘ Allertgen | DeltaHacks 2020
Allertgen is a web application which detects if an unfamiliar food item has a possibility of containing allergens that a user enters. It determines this through three different methods --> translating and parsing an unfamiliar menu or through a picture of the food item (identified through a image classification model). 

### Tech Stack and How We Built Allertgen
After having planned out the design flow, we sketched out our designs using Figma to build the UI using HTML/CSS. The majority of the back-end of our program was built using __Python__, which facilitated the use of Google Cloud for image classification (including building and training a machine learning model using __Google Cloud's AutoML__), and text detection/translation with Google Cloud's __Vision API__ and Google Cloud's __Translation API__. We also used Google Cloud's App Engine with Flask in order to integrate the Python back-end with the HTML/CSS front-end.
